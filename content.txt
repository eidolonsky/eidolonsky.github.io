I'm a graduate student from Shanghai, studying on Technical Communication and Information Design at IIT. Also, I am a photographer focusing on scenic, nature, architecture and BIRDS. I have several experiences as a journalist, editor, photographic journalist and graphic editor. Big fan of Liverpoolfc.

Background

I got my bachelor degree from SJTU(Shanghai Jiao Tong University) majored in Communication. My study on communication is mostly in the form of theories and practice in traditional media(newspaper, magazine, TV) and journalism. I spent six months on an exchange program in SU(Stockholm University). Most of my internships were as journalist and editor. I used to cover the job ranging from writing news to editing passages, from photographing to graphic design. And not being glad to recall the memory, I also spent three months interning in the marketing department of SMG(Shanghai Media Group).

All these happened before my graduation from SJTU, and I was thinking about the future about dipping in the traditional media industry. Finally, I decided to seek chance to further my study in communication with more emphasis on Internet and web. So, I came to IIT(Illinois Institute of Technology), studying Technical Communication and Information Design.

Ambitions

I take the hope of enhancing my abilities technically and broaden my horizons and knowledge in communication and information technology. With only several internship experiences, I would like to grab the opportunity of more communication practices to lay the foundation for my future careers.

I also hope to take more photos to demonstrate the world I live.

And, last but not least, please let Liverpool win one champion. To be realistic, a Capitol One Cup will work.
